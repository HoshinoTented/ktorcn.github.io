Do you need to send a message from Native or JVM to JavaScript or over the network?
Do you need to store a class in file and retrieve it later?
`kotlinx.serialization` allows you to do it.

`kotlinx.serialization` is OpenSource and you can find it at GitHub: <https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization>
