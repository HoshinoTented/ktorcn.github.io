Kotlin provides two killer features: multiplatform projects (including common projects) and coroutines.
But multiplatform doesn't provide any special functionality, only let's you to use the exposed APIs from each platform.
And coroutines are low-level too.

These libraries expose a common standard API for multiplatform projects: exposing atomic operations working in all platforms,
providing coroutine-aware asynchronous tools, or being able to serialize and deserialize from one platform to another.

Kotlinx.* (Kotlin eXtensions) libraries are OpenSource and you can find them at <https://github.com/Kotlin/>
