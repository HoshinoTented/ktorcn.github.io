There are two predefined storages: `SessionStorageMemory`, `DirectoryStorage`. And another composable storage: `CacheStorage`.

`DirectoryStorage` and `CacheStorage` are dependant on the `io.ktor:ktor-server-sessions:$ktor_version` artifact.
{: .note.artifact } 

In this mode, you are just sending a Session Id instead of the actual session contents.
This id is used to store its contents on the server side using a specific `SessionStorage`.
This mode is used when you specify a second argument with a storage in the `cookie` or `header` methods.

Example:

```kotlin
install(Sessions) {
    cookie<SampleSession>("SESSION_FEATURE_SESSION_ID", SessionStorageMemory()) {
        cookie.path = "/"
    }
}
```


## Custom SessionStorage

`SessionStorage` is in charge of storing and retrieving session payload. The interface is *suspendable*,
so you can, and should if it is possible, transfer the data asynchronously.

The data is transferred as a stream and the callee will pass consumers and providers offering the binary payload,
and the callee will be in charge of opening and closing those byte channels.

```kotlin
interface SessionStorage {
    suspend fun write(id: String, provider: suspend (ByteWriteChannel) -> Unit)
    suspend fun invalidate(id: String)
    suspend fun <R> read(id: String, consumer: suspend (ByteReadChannel) -> R): R
}
```

If the storage doesn't provide a meaningful way to store information as a stream, you might want to use
a simplified adaptor that just reads and writes it using `ByteArray`. It can also be used as an example to know
how to deal with the API in its primitive stream-based version.
