* Full changelog: <https://github.com/ktorio/ktor/compare/1.1.5...1.2.0>
* API Documentation: <https://api.ktor.io/1.2.0>

Published 14 May 2019

Version bumps:
* Kotlin: `1.3.30 -> 1.3.31`
* Kotlinx coroutines: `1.2.0 -> 1.2.1`

Breaking changes:
* Websocket frames and other related stuff have been modificed incompatibly due to multiplatform reasons.
* Core:
    * `HttpStatusCode.equals` now compares only status code numbers.
* Auth:
    * Server basic and digest auth now using UTF-8 by default (can be configured back to the legacy mode).
    * `UserHashedTableAuth` doesn't support constant hash salt anymore.
    * Cookie sessions are configured to set cookies at `/` by default.
    * Server authenticator config reworked to split provider and it's configuration.
* Servlet engine:
    * Servlet engine uses servlet init parameters first then context init parameters.
    * Servlet engine handles context path out of the box so one should NOT specify root context path in routing anymore. It is accessible in `ApplicationEnvironment.rootPath`.
* Serialization:
    * Serializing `Unit` in client now sends `{}`.
    * KotlinxSerializer moved to a separate artifact.
* All native libraries need to be recompiled with new Kotlin compiler and new libraries.
* `MockEngine` lambda receiver is changed to call.
* Okhttp client upgraded to 3.14.0 so java 8 need to be configured for Android. See https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-3130 and https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/okhttp-3-13-requires-android-5-818bb78d07ce .
