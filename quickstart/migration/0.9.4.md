### Changelog

Ktor 0.9.4 fixes some bugs, bumps some versions, improves the overall performance of the server.
This version deprecate some APIs, introduce new ones, and includes a new multiplatform HTTP client (initially supporting JVM, iOS and Android).

This version is expected to be mostly source-code compatible with 0.9.3 except for the deprecate APIs.

#### 0.9.4
{: #0.9.4}

Published 29 Aug 2018

Version Bumps:

* `Kotlin: 1.2.50 -> 1.2.61`
* `kotlin-native -> 0.8.2`
* `jetty_alpn_boot_version: 8.1.11.v20170118 -> 8.1.12.v20180117`
* `coroutines_version: 0.23.3 -> 0.25.0`
* `atomic_fu_version: -> 0.11.3`
* `kotlinx_io_version: -> 0.1.0-alpha-4`

Deprecations:

* [Deprecate `response.contentType` and `response.contentLength` extensions (`UnsafeHeaderException: Header Content is controlled by the engine and cannot be set explicitly`)](#UnsafeHeaderException)
* Strengthen `IncomingContent` deprecation, prepare for complete removal
* Remove obsolete H2 protocol type
* Rename `XForwardedHeadersSupport` to `XForwardedHeaderSupport` ([#547])

Minor potentially breaking changes:

* URL building: Set the default port too when changing the protocol
* Prohibit appending unsafe headers to request headers
* Client: the `io.ktor:ktor-client-json` artifact has been renamed to `io.ktor:io.ktor:ktor-client-gson` (to support a new JacksonSerializer)
* [Changed `Date` to `GMTDate` in some specific internal places](#GMTDate)
* [Internal Client `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse` and `HttpRequestData` changes](#client-request-response)

Fixes:

* Netty: fix write pipeline to not drop connection too early. Large responses are not completely sent with 'Connection: close' ([#534]) 
* Fixes `CharBufferBuilder` issue: CIO Responses with more than 2048 characters in header result in `IndexOutOfBoundsException` ([#419])
* Fix push promise headers order with Netty and HTTP/2
* Eliminate sending transfer-encoding sending with Netty and HTTP/2
* Fixed encoding issue with binary data in `TestApplicationRequest.setBody`
* Fix native Deflater leak ([#489])
* Fix resourceResource to check for regular file to prevent failing later with folders ([#490])
* Fix `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` in static resource resolution ([#493])
* Fixes: When config is passed via `-config=<filename>`, environment variables are not resolved ([#374])
* Fixes Client connection close in pipelining
* TLS: Fix exception on expected channel close
* Fix Jetty client engine response cancel
* Compression: fix messages with predefined identity encoding
* Fix HTTP 417 status message 
* Fix JWT error handling for missing keyId or broken token
* CIO: fix duplicate content-length header handling
* Fix CIO pipeline to not interrupt write pipeline. This was causing pipeline to be cancelled and 400 Bad Request response was lost
* Fix closed byte channel error handling for WriteChannelContent
* Fix CIO client joining
* Fix race responding bytes that caused an empty response with Netty relates to issue [#350]
* Avoid closing ServletOutputStream even in case of error
* Suppress already completed `AsyncContext` error
* Handle response cancel in Jetty client engine
* Make `SessionTransportTransformerEncrypt` return null on failure
* Fix client attributes evaluation

Optimizations:

* Use garbage-free headers API in Netty
* Avoid unnecessary allocations in Pipeline#merge
* Improve best function selection in ApplicationEngineEnvironmentReloading
* Do not scan classpath on every `HttpClient` instantiation, provide better error message

Improvements to existing APIs:

* JWK: add verify configuration with optional issuer
* Url and URLBuilder improvements
* Make TypeInfo a data class ([#459]) ([#471])
* Testing: Add advanced test exception logging

* Add client form data and multipart support ([#500])
* Add `HttpStatusCode` constants for the status codes defined in RFC 2518 (WebDAV)

* Add jetty server engine failed callback handler(http2)
* Wrap Jetty channel fail into `ChannelIOException`
* Wrap client exception from response pipeline with request and typeInfo

* Add utility to append header value (such as content type)

* Improve netty response pipeline for HTTP/2 case 
* Set default random algorithm from system provided

New features:

* New multiplatform HTTP Client:
* Add initial webjars feature ([#498])
* Add `EngineAPI` marker annotation
* Add `JacksonSerializer` to HTTP Client
* Client: Add `HttpResponse.receive` method
* Client: Add default request configurator
* Client: New way to configure or reconfigure the HttpClient Engine

Internal changes:

* Internal: Update modules layout

### New multiplatform HTTP Client

Starting with Ktor 0.9.4, there is a MPP HTTP Client included with Ktor.

In 0.9.4, the client is implemented for the JVM, Android and iOS.

We provide a sample of this feature as part of the ktor-samples repo:
[ktor-samples/client-mpp](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples/tree/master/mpp/client-mpp)

You can read more about this feature in the [Multiplatform HTTP Client]() page.


### Reconfiguring the HttpClientEngineConfig

Prior to 0.9.4, you had to configure the HttpClient Engine by:

```kotlin
HttpClient(MyEngine.config {
    // ... config ...
}) {
    install {
    }
}
```

Since 0.9.4, `HttpClientConfig` provides an `engine` method to reconfigure or configure the `HttpClientEngineConfig`:

```kotlin
HttpClient(MyEngine) {
    engine {
        // ... config ... 
    }
    install {
    }
}
```

### UnsafeHeaderException
{: #UnsafeHeaderException }

Since 0.9.4, and after a period of deprecation, Ktor started to completely forbid to set `contentType` and `contentLength` headers directly.
This is because those are bound to the `OutgoingContent` instances, that is the object describing the body of the response.

The `respondText`, `respondBytes` and other methods, allow you to set the Content-Type as an optional argument.
And when using any subtype of `OutgoingContent`, you can set the `contentType` there.

For more information about this topic, check the [Generating HTTP Responses](/servers/calls/responses.html) page.

### GMTDate
{: #GMTDate }

In some places (like Client `HttpResponse`) we were using Java's `Date` class. Now we are using `GMTDate` instead.


### Client `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse` and `HttpRequestData` changes
{: #client-request-response }

Previously the `HttpRequestData`, had an attributes method to build an `Attributes` instance from another.
Now it is a property instead. `Attributes().apply { data.attributes(this) }` would become `data.attributes`.

This change, affects, for example when implementing a `HttpRequest`:

```kotlin
override val attributes: Attributes = Attributes().apply { data.attributes(this) }
// -->
//override val attributes: Attributes = data.attributes
```

And the `HttpResponse` changed its `requestTime` and `responseTime` from java's `Date` to `io.ktor.util.date.GMTDate`.
