Ktor 0.9.3 fixes some bugs, bumps some versions, improves the overall performance of the server,
and introduces new APIs and changes for some of them.

This version is expected to be mostly source-code compatible with 0.9.2
except for advanced use-cases related with `kotlinx.coroutines` and Ktor Raw sockets.

* You can check the [breaking changes from `kotlinx.coroutines`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/CHANGES.md#version-0230).
* You can check the [breaking changes from `ktor raw sockets`](#sockets).

## Client

### WebSocket improvements

Now `webSocketSession` and `webSocketRawSession` return `DefaultClientWebSocketSession`
and `webSocket`, `ws` and `wss` methods also receives a `DefaultClientWebSocketSession` and other methods
return a `ClientWebSocketSession`.

This prevents having to cast to access some properties from the client session:

```kotlin
var DefaultWebSocketSession.pingInterval: Duration?
var DefaultWebSocketSession.timeout: Duration
val DefaultWebSocketSession.closeReason: Deferred<CloseReason?>
var DefaultClientWebSocketSession.masking: Boolean
```

### HttpClient MockEngine

We had a `MockEngine` available internally for our tests for creating an HttpClient that was able to respond
from our code programmatically without actually performing any request.

We have now exposed it in the `io.ktor:ktor-client-mock` artifact.

For example:

```kotlin
val mockEngine = MockEngine { call -> // suspend HttpRequest.(call: HttpClientCall) -> MockHttpResponse
    assertEquals("*/*", headers[HttpHeaders.Accept])

    MockHttpResponse(call, HttpStatusCode.OK, writer(ioCoroutineDispatcher) { channel.writeStringUtf8("HELLO") }.channel, headersOf(
        "X-Custom-Header" to listOf("value")
    ))
}

val client = HttpClient(mockEngine)
```

Inside the MockEngine block, you can assert things from the request, or decide how to generate a response based on
the request.

### HttpClient default Engine

Now you can instantiate HttpClient by just `HttpClient()` without providing an engine.
In that case it will use a `ServiceLoader` to find a suitable implementation based on the artifacts you have included.

### HttpClient bug fixes

Now the HttpClient sends cookies in a standard way with one single header separating cookies by `;`.

Reading an empty body as String with an Httpclient (`HttpClient.get<String>`) was causing a
`No transformation found: class io.ktor.client.engine.apache.ApacheHttpResponse -> class kotlin.String` exception.

### HttpClientEngine changes

HttpClientEngine now has a `config` field. So you will have to provide it in the case you have a custom engine.

### HttpClient changes

Now the HttpClient sends an `Accept` header. If you have a test checking all the headers, you will need to update them. 

## Sockets

### TLS improvements

Ktor implements secure sockets using [CIO](/quickstart/faq.html#cio), and the TLS available
before 0.9.3 missed some cypher suites and encryption methods. We have updated it to support more required stuff.

Some errors you could encounter that now might be fixed:

* `Exception in thread "io-thread-1" io.ktor.network.tls.TLSException: Received alert during handshake. Level: FATAL, code: HandshakeFailure`
* `Exception in thread "io-thread-2" io.ktor.network.tls.TLSException: Unsupported TLS handshake type CertificateRequest`

### aSocket breaking change

`aSocket` now requires a SelectorManager to be provided.

For example:

`aSocket(ActorSelectorManager(ioCoroutineDispatcher))`

Of course, you can reuse the SelectorManager:

```kotlin
val mySocketSelector = ActorSelectorManager(ioCoroutineDispatcher)
val socket = aSocket(mySocketSelector).tcp()
```

## Server

### WebSocket improvements

Before 0.9.3, when a WS request was made without the `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header,
an `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown. Now it is optional.

### Optional Authentication

Now it is possible to define a set of routes where you can provide authentication, but it is optional:

```kotlin
authenticate("method", optional = true) {
    // routes
}
```

The authenticate behaviour:

* No authentication provided:
  * `optional=false`: challenge is performed
  * `optional=true`: route handler is executed with principal=null
* Wrong credentials: Unauthorized
* Valid credentials: route handler is executed with the principal generated from the authentication method 

### Missing call.respondBytes

Before 0.9.3 we had `call.respondText` but missed `call.respondBytes`. We have solved this.

### Version bumps

Ktor now uses `Kotlin 1.2.50` and `kotlinx.coroutines 0.23.3`.

kotlinx.coroutines has some [breaking changes](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/CHANGES.md#version-0230) for advanced use-cases.

## generateCertificate

We have moved the `generateCertificate` function for generating self-signed certificates to the `ktor-network-tls` artifact:
`compile "io.ktor:ktor-network-tls:$ktor_version"` 


### New ktor-samples repository

Before 0.9.3, we had several sample projects integrated directly in the ktor repository.
They have grown, and we have moved them to their own repository: <https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples>
