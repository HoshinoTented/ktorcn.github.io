### 0.9.5
{: #0.9.5}

Published 19 Sep 2018

Version Bumps:

* `Kotlin: 1.2.61 -> 1.2.70`

Minor potential breaking changes:

* Client's `CookiesStorage.get`, `CookiesStorage.addCookie` and `HttpCookies.get` now accepts the requestUrl
  instead of the host. Now the get returns a list of cookies.
* Made HTTP Client extension method `HttpRequest.takeFrom(builder: HttpRequestBuilder): HttpRequestBuilder`. Now also sets the typed call attributes from the `builder`.
  into a member method. Shouldn't be a source compatibility problem when using star imports `*` since it is in the same package.

Fixes:

* `HttpClient.config` was not preserving the base configuration ([#559])
* Fixed path and query escaping and make it consistent with `URLBuilder` ([#577]).
* Fixed setting charset encoding for non-text content types

Additions:

* Introduced `CallId` feature
* Added `MDC` support to `CallLogging` feature

API Improvements:

* Added shorthand client functions for `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods ([#562])
* HTTP Client: Added `List<Cookie>.get(name: String): Cookie?` shortcut.
* HTTP Client: Added `fun FormBuilder.append(key: String, filename: String, block: BytePacketBuilder.() -> Unit)` to the FORM DSL.
* URLBuilder's parser improved ([#553], [#567])
* Added `respondOutputStream { }` response function
* Split `Infrastructure` phase into `Monitoring` and `Features` phases

Internal:

* Made `AcceptAllCookiesStorage` be the same for all the implementations.
* Improved client's cookie matching and processing

### New http method shorcuts for the HTTP client
{: #client-http-method-shortcuts }

Before 0.9.5, when using the HTTP client and wanting to make a `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` request,
you had to either use the `HttpClient.request` or the `HttpClient.call`.

As for 0.9.5, in addition to `HttpClient.get` and `HttpClient.post` there are now four more convenience methods
`HttpClient.head`, `HttpClient.options`, `HttpClient.patch` and `HttpClient.delete` HTTP verbs. 

### Split `Infrastructure` phase into `Monitoring` and `Features` phases
{: #infrastructure-phase-split }

In most of the cases, you should use the `Features` phase instead of the `Infrastructure` one:

```kotlin
intercept(ApplicationCallPipeline.Infrastructure) {
    // ...
}
```

would become:

```kotlin
intercept(ApplicationCallPipeline.Features) {
    // ...
}
```
